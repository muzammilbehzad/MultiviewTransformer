# Multi-view Transformer (MiT)
This repo can be used to work with deep learning models that use multi-views from 3D/4D point clouds. We present MiT: a novel multi-view transformer model for 3D/4D facial affect recognition. MiT incorporates patch and position embeddings from various patches of multi-views and uses them for learning various facial muscle movements to showcase an effective recognition performance.

Note: The research paper based on this repo is currently under review.
